## Cheddar for Android

This is a universal Android app for [Cheddar](http://cheddarapp.com), a simple task manager.

## Getting started

Get the latest source 
  
  * $git clone https://github.com/aliHafizji/Cheddar-Android.git
  * Import the project in eclipse.
  * Build and Run

The project depends on some external libraries.

  * [Android-PullToRefresh](https://github.com/chrisbanes/Android-PullToRefresh)
  * [Android-DragAndDropListView](https://github.com/bauerca/drag-sort-listview)

Download them and add them as library dependencies.

## Cheddar now on the Play store

The app is now available on the Android play [store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.creativeperson.cheddar). There are still things left to implement such as:

  * Support Android versions below Honeycomb (This will require a lot of changes to the styles used)
  * Get the realtime API working (The only reason why this is not included is that I don't like any of the current Android libraries for [Pusher](http://pusher.com/docs/client_libraries#android-java). So first I need to make one)
